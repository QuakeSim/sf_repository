This project contains three user interfaces:

1) DailyRdahmmJplSmall.jsp is for embedding in gadgets and other places with limited real estate.

2) DailyRdahmm.jsp is the portlet version of the user interface.

3) DailyRdahmmSep.jsp is the standalone version of the user interface.

Effort will be concentrated in maintaining #3, primarily at the expense of #2.  

All these interfaces depend upon RDAHMM processing services, and the top-level POM needs to be configured 
correctly. Current working values are (assuming you are running the tests on a localhost tomcat server):

	<local.hostname>localhost:8080</local.hostname>
	<dailyRdahmmResult.service.hostname>gf13.ucs.indiana.edu</dailyRdahmmResult.service.hostname>
	<dailyRdahmm.service.hostname>gf13.ucs.indiana.edu</dailyRdahmm.service.hostname>

The user interface also depends on the local deployment of supporting Web services in QuakeSim2/Execution services: DailyRDAHMMREsultService. This is probably a JavaScript sandbox issue.
